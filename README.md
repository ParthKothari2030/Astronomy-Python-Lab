    In Semester 1, I undertook the <strong>AA651 course</strong>, which provided a comprehensive introduction to <strong>Python programming</strong>. The curriculum covered fundamental concepts, including <strong>data types</strong>, <strong>control structures</strong>, and <strong>functions</strong>, and progressed to intermediate topics such as <strong>object-oriented programming</strong>, <strong>file handling</strong>, and <strong>basic data analysis</strong>. This course built a strong foundation in Python, equipping me with the skills necessary for more advanced programming applications in <strong>scientific computing</strong>.
</p>

<p>
    All the <strong>Python codes</strong> I developed for the assignments in the AA651 course are provided in this repository, along with the corresponding <strong>assignment questions</strong>. These include solutions to various problems that were designed to reinforce programming concepts and build practical <strong>problem-solving skills</strong>.
</p>

<h2>1. Basic Numerical Techniques for Astrophysics and Cosmology </h2>
<div class="content"> <p>
    The first assignment focuses on <strong>basic data types in Python</strong>, emphasizing the differences between <strong>float32</strong> and <strong>float64</strong>. It also covers the process of understanding basic algorithms written on paper and implementing them programmatically using <strong>loops</strong>.
</p>
 </div>

<h2>2. Basic Numerical Techniques for Astrophysics and Cosmology - II </h2>
<div class="content"><p>
    The second assignment emphasizes the use of the <strong>SciPy</strong> library to perform <strong>numerical integrations</strong>. It involves solving the <strong>orbit equation</strong> and simulating the <strong>1D motion of a particle</strong> in a given potential, showcasing the practical application of computational methods in physics.
</p>

<h2>3.  Basic Numerical Techniques for Astrophysics and Cosmology - III </h2>
<div class="content"><p>
    The third assignment focuses on solving <strong>ordinary differential equations (ODEs)</strong> through manual implementation. It involves using the <strong>Euler</strong>, <strong>RK2</strong>, and <strong>RK4 methods</strong> to solve the <strong>orbit equation in phase space</strong>. Additionally, the assignment includes a problem on solving the <strong>equation of motion</strong> for projectile motion by incorporating <strong>air resistance</strong>.

<h2>4. Stationarity Check For Astronomical Data Set </h2>
<div class="content"><p>
    Assignment 5 serves as a foundational exercise in time series analysis, focusing on checking the <strong>stationarity</strong> of three astronomical data sets. This task involves analyzing the data for trends, seasonality, and other properties that determine whether the data is stationary. Understanding stationarity is a crucial step, as it lays the groundwork for applying <strong>ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)</strong> modelling, which is widely used for forecasting and analyzing time series data in various scientific fields.

<h2>5. Time series analysis</h2>
<div class="content"><p>
    Assignment 6 is a mini project focused on <strong>time series analysis</strong>, where we utilize the <strong>statsmodels</strong> library, specifically the <strong>ARIMA module</strong>, to make both <strong>COVID-19</strong> and <strong>MJD</strong> data stationary. The assignment involves applying appropriate transformations to achieve stationarity, followed by <strong>forecasting</strong> future values based on historical data. This exercise helps us understand the practical application of ARIMA models for time series forecasting.

    In Semester 1, I undertook the <strong>AA651 course</strong>, which provided a comprehensive introduction to <strong>Python programming</strong>. The curriculum covered fundamental concepts, including <strong>data types</strong>, <strong>control structures</strong>, and <strong>functions</strong>, and progressed to intermediate topics such as <strong>object-oriented programming</strong>, <strong>file handling</strong>, and <strong>basic data analysis</strong>. This course built a strong foundation in Python, equipping me with the skills necessary for more advanced programming applications in <strong>scientific computing</strong>.

<p>
    All the <strong>Python codes</strong> I developed for the assignments in the AA651 course are provided in this repository, along with the corresponding <strong>assignment questions</strong>. These include solutions to various problems that were designed to reinforce programming concepts and build practical <strong>problem-solving skills</strong>.
